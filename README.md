# Logan_Santos_Website

Logan Santos Personal Website

This project is a simple single page website for sharing my professional contacts and links. The overall goal was to create a small website to use as a professional hub while keeping the design simple and straight forward. 

LoganSantos.com was built using HTML5 and CSS.

To use the personal website, all it takes is to go to LoganSantos.com and selecting the buttons that will take the user to the corresponding website or default email messenger.

UPCOMING FEATURES: uploaded resume, individual project selection (using JavaScript), weblinks to news articles involving myself, and skills list.
